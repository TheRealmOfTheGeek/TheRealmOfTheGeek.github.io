# Plugins
![EULA](/images/eulaComp.png)
- [EULA Compliant Ranks](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/eula-compliant-perks.35134/) - EULA Compliant Ranks is an open source plugin that allows you to give your donators 10+ more permissions (listed below) So, why is it so great? It allows for actually useful commands and permissions!!! 10+ Hours have gone into creating this plugin, and this is my current main project, so it will be constantly updating, so make sure to follow!
![Simple Polls](/images/simplePolls.png)
- [Simple Polls](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/simple-polls.29441/) - Ever want a SUPER easy poll plugin? Well here you go! Simple Polls only has 3 commands, start, vote, and end. Automated Win detection (Yes won, or no won for the votes). Test Driven Development was used in the process of this plugin. The Simple Polls plugin development was livestreamed on live.kentonvizdos.com and youtube.com/TheRealmOfTheGeek/Live, where all of my plugins are streamed!
![You Legit?](/images/youLegit.png)
- [You Legit?](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/you-legit.30043/) - Most of you have probably heard of the player login systems, but those are annoying for regular players to need to login each time they join.. NOW theres a better solution! Bringing you...


YOU LEGIT?
You Legit? is a login system just for staff.

When a staff is made a staff with /addstaff <user> (YouLegit.add) it will message them a eleven digit code (With numbers and letters) for them to use when they Login! The greatest part is that normal players don't need to use the login!

Another amazing feature: Unbreakable. Its unbreakable because all of the keys are locked in a config, so only people that have access to the server directory have access. If a hacker gets into the server, I don't think they would be wanting to just get into a players account, so they would most likely just delete the whole server. #Security.

Features:
On Staff Join, makes them spectator mode, and they are NOT allowed to use any command other than /youlegit.
11 Digit, secure code
