# Plugins

- [EULA Compliant Ranks](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/eula-compliant-perks.35134/) - EULA Compliant Ranks is an open source plugin that allows you to give your donators 10+ more permissions (listed below) So, why is it so great? It allows for actually useful commands and permissions!!! 10+ Hours have gone into creating this plugin, and this is my current main project, so it will be constantly updating, so make sure to follow!
![Simple Polls](/images/simplePolls.png)
- [Simple Polls](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/simple-polls.29441/) - Ever want a SUPER easy poll plugin? Well here you go! Simple Polls only has 3 commands, start, vote, and end. Automated Win detection (Yes won, or no won for the votes). Test Driven Development was used in the process of this plugin. The Simple Polls plugin development was livestreamed on live.kentonvizdos.com and youtube.com/TheRealmOfTheGeek/Live, where all of my plugins are streamed!
